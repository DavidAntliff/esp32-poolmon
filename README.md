## One Wire Bus

The DS18B20 needs extra current for EEPROM writes and Temperature measurements.

Vpup is the pullup voltage.

Vpupmin is the minimum pull up voltage and is usually 2.8V (not sure how this can be calculated from datasheet).

For a given Vpup and Rpup, the difference between Vpup and Vpupmin determines the current available for special functions:

    Iavail = (Vpup - Vpip_min) / Rpup

For the DS18B20 at 3.3V:

    Vpup = 3.3V
    Rpup = 4.7kâ„¦
    Vpupmin = 2.8V
    => Iavail = 0.106mA
    
This is probably too low for a single device.

TODO: calculate a better Rpup resistor value.
